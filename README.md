# Summary

This is a Python script that leverages the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Python SDK for fetching the usage and cost details for a specified tenancy. If the expenses surpass a specific threshold, it dispatches alerts. It's only meant to be used by me, but you can modify it to suit your needs.
